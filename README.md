my advent of code solutions for 2024... im such a rust newbie

why the hell are strings so weird in rust??? Ok. it makes sense with bytes and chars and graphemes or wtvr.
but... that just makes me have to think harder about stuff. wth. Also results and options have so many different
ways of resolving them. unwrap and unwrap_or and augh. the flip.

ahhhhhhhhhhh my part 1 was so terrible. idk if complete search is the most efficient.
coding the conditionals was annoying, especially with weird rust stuff.
